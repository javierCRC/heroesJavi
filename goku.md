For the entire Tournament of Power, the final storyline in Dragon Ball Super,
Universe 11's Jiren has dominated the martial arts competition, 
easily shrugging off attacks from the champions of various realities across the Dragon Ball Multiverse. 
He's also revealed himself to have combat strength on par with the gods.
While the anime series' protagonists from Universe 7 have put up a valiant fight and given Jiren the most trouble, 
forcing him to unleash his full potential for the first time, 
the Pride Trooper has still very much had the battle under control.
